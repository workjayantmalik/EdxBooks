        <h2 id="app.js-helper-functions">App.js Helper Functions</h2>
        <p>I decided to distribute the code in functions to make it easy to organise. The code is still not properly organised, because it is all written in a single file.</p>
        <p>Helper functions just execute the query and returns the data which is then used by the main application functions responsible for handling routes.</p>
        <h2 id="app.js-logged-in-routes">App.js Logged In routes</h2>
        <p>The routes that will serve the content to logged in users only.</p>
        <p>There are two different tasks such are signup and login that are not implemented in this section.</p>
        <h2 id="app.js-api-and-good-reads-routes">App.js Api and Good Reads Routes</h2>
        <p>The section contains a function which just fetches information from goodreads api and returns it as json. This function is a helper function for api and other application routes.</p>
        <p>The second function servers as an api route that is responsible for sending data to user.</p>
        <h2 id="app.js-authentication-routes">App.js Authentication Routes</h2>
        <p>The routes are login and signup, which allows a user to create a new account and login using the existing account.</p>
        <p>For the simplicity the passwords are not encrypted before storing in the database.</p>
        <h2 id="video-url">Video URL</h2>
        <p>The video is available on youtube, explaining all the functionality of the application. My videos are usually longer than 5 to 10 minutes, because i donâ€™t have editing skills. The video URL is <a href="https://youtu.be/-irF01kCQ8c">https://youtu.be/-irF01kCQ8c</a></p>
        <h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>
        <p>I have tried to complete all the requirements specified by the Project 1.</p>
        <p>Happy Coding, and Thanks from Jayant Malik.</p>
